									<h2>Amersham Town Football Club 2021</h2>
									<p>This was my first allotted ‘field’ exercise at the NFTS and in my opinion it didn’t give enough time to get to know the interviewees who were chosen more or less on the day. I think this depreciated possible story value for this short feature but helped reinforce the theory repeated that a good story needs detailed protagonists. 
										Fortunately I think the weather enriched the idyllic location and helped create a beautiful shot or two.</p>

									<h2>Bryson DeChambeau and the Future of Golf</h2>
									<p>The instructed purpose of this exercise was to create and archive feature on a topic of our choosing and stage interviews with acting ‘experts’ to use in the piece.
										One of my actors knew a fair amount about golf so I staged him as a golf television executive with a bright open-plan set up. To contrast this I staged my other actor as an antiquated ‘golf-enthusiast’ outside. I tried to conduct the interviews in a conversational manner while still referring to specific golfing moments to help me with editing. I transcribed the interviews which were roughly fifteen minutes long and chopped up the best statements into three arching questions which I superimposed. 
										I definitely enjoyed doing this feature as I love the subject and hopefully this came through.</p>

									<h2>A Guide to Beaconsfield</h2>
									<p>This exercise was designed as a way for my course of 6 to get to know some equipment. We were split into pairs to put together a Guide to Beaconsfield with no further brief. 
										I raised the issue of impending boredom with creating a factual guide to Beaconsfield to my partner Liv and she agreed. Upon seeing her car and failing to see her personality fit into it I proposed a mockumentary version of the guide with her as the subject. Liv was on board and we had a lot of fun with it. I chose to use the camera on my shoulder in order to create a mockumentary style.

									<h2>Liberal Arts: Final Year Project Submission</h2>
									<p>As my undergraduate degree progressed I had become fond of expressing ideas visually and elected to do a short documentary-essay for my Final Year Project as opposed to a written dissertation.
										Now at film school, there is a lot I would do differently such as shooting more b-roll and staging interviews in different ways. I also would have produced differently by being more prepared with things like a running order. I used a smart-phone to film my own material in the video, however, access to more sophisticated equipment was not straightforward and in any case this may have helped the essay-feel of the piece.
										This feature definitely helped me become more familiar with online resources such as royalty free material.

									<h2>Bloomsbury 2020</h2>
									<p>Working part-time for ambitious, Nike Partner Club, Bloomsbury Football Academy, (Nov-Dec), I created online interactive content through the country's second lockdown, which immersed me into the universe of football edits. The Skill Up series engaged Academy youngsters and helped me develop further on Adobe PP. Through music selection and playful edits I think I got better throughout the series at matching the Academy brand. 
										I also created 'Tactics clips' and more refined promotions like the instagram advert seen here.

									<h2>Football Aid Prototype </h2>
									<p>In October 2020 I was asked to pitch a video advert for the charity, Football Aid, in preparation for their most recent ex-professional shirt auction. This sounded a good opportunity because I have always loved football adverts - particularly those with a good and true message - and hoped to create something in this vein. 
										I came up with the idea to base the ad around the idea of 'influence', to spark a sense of nostalgia among our target audience for how they used to adore their favourite stars, hence casting a young boy as the protagonist.
										With a very tight two week deadline I produced this to demonstrate the idea. Football Aid liked it but felt they would run into licensing and production issues. I do feel an ad like this could work with a proper team and budget in the future and am still interested in doing similar projects some day.

									<h2>Investigation Soprano</h2>
									<p>This character analysis was my first real venture into Adobe Premiere Pro. Through doing it I learnt how to use music to elevate a video's message and after sieving through 6 series of the show I was content with the introspective and conflicted personality I hope I unveiled in Christopher Moltisanti.
